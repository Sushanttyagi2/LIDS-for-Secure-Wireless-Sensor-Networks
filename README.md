Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Secure Wireless Sensor Networks.

#1 Overview
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in environmental monitoring, healthcare, military surveillance, and smart cities. However, due to limited computational power, battery constraints, and open wireless communication, WSNs are highly vulnerable to security threats.

#2 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
A typical WSN consists of:
Sensor nodes
Cluster heads
Sink/base station
Wireless communication links

 #3 Problem Statement
WSNs are vulnerable to multiple attacks such as:
Sinkhole attacks
Selective forwarding attacks
Sybil attacks
Spoofing attacks
Traditional security mechanisms like heavy cryptographic systems and centralized IDS frameworks are not suitable due to:
Limited battery life

#4 Objectives
Understand WSN security threats
Design IDS architecture for constrained devices
Apply lightweight ML models for anomaly detection
Analyze detection accuracy and false positive rate
Evaluate security–energy trade-offs
